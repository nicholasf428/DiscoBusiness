My name is Nicholas Farmer and I am an aspiring developer starting my journey through Tech Elevator. 
I am currently enrolled at Tech Elevator for their Full Stack Java developer course, and I am excited to get to learning!
Some of my favorite hobbies outside of coding include music/playing guitar, Japanese language learning, video games, and art.
